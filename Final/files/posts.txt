While there, were were able to stop at two local breweries - Hale's Ales and Bad Jimmy's.</p><h3>Hale's Ales</h3><img src=\"img/hales.jpg\" class=\"blog-img\" alt=\"Hale's Ales\"><p>Hale's Ales is one of the first breweries to pop up in the Fremont area. The two brews we shared - a cream ale and a barrel-aged stout - were quite delicious, as was the bread pudding.</p><h3>Bad Jimmy's</h3><img src=\"img/jimmys.jpg\" class=\"blog-img\" alt=\"Flight at Bad Jimmy's.\"><p>Bad Jimmy's Brewing is just a block away from Hale's. A small place situated back off the street, but very welcoming. We got a flight of beers to try, including a Samoa Girl Scout Cookie inspired beer and a habanero amber ale. Their small operation allows them to take chances and experiment with their batches, which I always welcome."

Of course, no first trip to Seattle would be complete without exploring the markets at Pike Place.</p><p>After taking in the market and watching the obligatory fish tosses, we stopped in at Pike Brewing for lunch and sampled a flight of their flagship beers (picture above). While none of the brews really blew me away, they were decent enough and the food was tasty. I would be interested in trying some of their seasonal or limited releases when we next find ourselves on the west coast."

Here I hope to chronicle my love of beer through various outings to breweries or just reviewing beers that I've had. Please stay and look around. Enjoy."

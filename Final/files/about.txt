Background
My name is Mike Bowen, born and raised in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh. I spent 21 years (okay, more like 18 shhh!) not knowing the wonders of alcohol, and another 6 or 7 to appreciate anything other than the cheap American light lager. Once I delved into the world of craft beer, there was no looking back.
Education
I graduated top of my class from Woodland Hills High School in 2002. I went to the University of Pittsburgh out of high school but due to various circumstances was unable to finish my degree. I finished an Associate's Degree in Software Development at CCAC in 2014 and am now 18 credits away from completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh.
Employment
I currently work full time as an Operation Support Assistant for UPMC Community Providers Services where I provide a litany of computer, database, and administrative services. Prior to this position, I was a Data Entry Clerk for UPMC/Jefferson Regional Home Health.
Homebrewing
I've recently begun to brew my own beers at home, a pasttime that is becoming increasingly easy to access due to the craft beer explosion and the rise of specialty home brew supply shops. To date I have made three batches - an American porter I call "I Blue My Lid", a Belgian-style dubbel nicknamed "Oh No! There's Snow", and a Victorian Era English ale that is currently in bottles conditioning.
Hobbies
Other than beer, I enjoy a multitude of activities. Foremost amongst them would be playing video games (currently Rocket League, Diablo 3, and Fallout 4), listening to comedy podcasts (My Brother, My Brother and Me, Comedy Bang! Bang!) and trying my hand at baking various breads and desserts.
